Hi there! This is the third release of WindowLabyrinth for PC-GEM.
It was originally an Atari-GEM program, but with some few changes, it runs
now with PC-GEM!

WinLaby is Public Domain. That means that everybody can copy it freely and
you may even change the source! But please keep the name of the author of the
original, Thomas Huth, in the program and this readme file.
I would be also glad if you wrote me an e-mail about what you think about
this game, or error reports (about my poor English...?) and so on:

 thomashuth@gmx.net

The idea of the game is simple: Find the exit of the labyrinths! You can even
edit your own labyrinths, simply look at the *.lab files. You can move and
turn around either with the cursor keys or with 2, 4, 6 and 8.


 **** GEM rulez ;-) Have fun! ****
