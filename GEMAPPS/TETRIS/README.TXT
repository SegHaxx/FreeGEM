   GEMTetris

One day I browsed throught some Atari CD-ROMs and I found a Tetris clone with
source code. It already had a GEM interface but it still used some Atari ST
specific OS calls. I decided to adapt it to PC-GEM and finally I really
succeeded. The source is in a little bit messy state, but it works, so what
do you want else? I used Pacific-C to compile it for FreeGEM (thanks to the
gem-dev folks!). So feel free to improve this little game.
This is now the third release of the game - it features now a moveable window
and some other improvements and I have fixed some bugs. Enjoy!
